# keylogger
This Python-based keylogger script is designed to monitor and record keystrokes on a target computer. Utilizing the pynput library, it captures each key press and logs the data into a file. Additionally, it integrates with the Telegram API to send the logged keystrokes to a specified chat ID for remote monitoring. The script operates in multiple iterations, continuously capturing keystrokes and transmitting the data. To ensure privacy and security, the captured data is encrypted using the Fernet encryption method before transmission. The keylogger also includes functionality to take periodic screenshots, capture clipboard contents, and send these via Telegram, providing comprehensive monitoring capabilities. This tool is useful for understanding user activity on a computer, ensuring secure data collection and remote access
